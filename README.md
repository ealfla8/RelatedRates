# RelatedRates

This related rates program was made to help students calculate and visualize derivatives for multiple 3D shapes (cylinder, sphere, cone, and cube). Users can select the shape, the quantity they want to find the rate of change for, and put in numbers for the necessary values. After inputting the numeric values, a labeled graph will be drawn showing the relation between the two changes in quantities. 

The program was made with the Tkinter package and the NumPy and Matplotlib libraries.
